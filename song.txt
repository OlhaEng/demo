How are you sleeping at night?
How do you close both your eyes,
Living with all of those lives
On your hands?
Standing alone on that hill,
Using your fuel to kill.
We won’t take it standing still,
Watch us dancе.

We’re gonna dance on gasoline!
We’re gonna dance on gasoline!
We’re gonna dance on gasoline!
